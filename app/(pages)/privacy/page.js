          <p className="mt-10">
            When contacting SerengetiNexus.com via our website, we request
            personal information including your name, phone number, and email
            address. We need this information to process a quotation for you
            and/or to contact you with our brochure. This information will not
            be given to any third party, except to the extent and for the
            purpose we may be required to do so by any law. We would like to
            hold your email address for our own future marketing purposes (with
            relevant promotions, offers, or information that you have expressed
            an interest in or that might be of interest to you). On our ‘Contact
            Us’ form, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
            occasional marketing information from Superior Kilimanjaro And
            Safaris.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10">
            We will only disclose your name and booking details/holiday proposal
            to our suppliers for operational purposes. We will not share your
            personal information for marketing or any other purposes without
            your consent unless where required by law. We will always respect
            your privacy and any personal communication between you and
            ourselves. We will always comply with any data protection
            legislation currently in force. We collect information about
            visitors to our website for general reporting, to improve future
            content, and to help recognize and service a potential booking.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10">
            Data security is of the utmost importance to us, and we are
            committed to ensuring the information we collect from you is secure.
            All the information you give us is protected by a secure server. The
            secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all
            information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is
            only de-encrypted when it reaches our server. We also have a
            Firewall (security software) in place to protect our internal
            information from the Internet.

          <p className="mt-10">
            We use cookies on our website for a variety of reasons. Cookies let
            us identify the device you are using and how you use our website,
            but not you personally. Cookies record anonymous information about

          <p className="mt-10">
            Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer when you
            visit a website; however, they cannot be used to identify you
            personally and are not harmful to your computer. They are essential
            for many features of our website to work, helping us to identify
            which pages are being used to analyze data and improve our site. We
            only use this information for statistical analysis purposes, and
            they in no way give us any information about you.

            We also use Google Analytics to measure and collect session
            information, length of visits to certain pages, repeat visits, and
            page interaction information. Google Analytics collects only the IP
            address assigned to you on the date you visit our website, rather
            than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine
            the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with
            personally identifiable information.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-10">
            You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return
            visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser. We may use
            the information from Google Analytics for marketing purposes to
            display adverts on our or other websites based upon your prior
            visits to our website. Any data collected will be used in accordance
            with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.

            over and take no responsibility for any information submitted to
            these sites.
